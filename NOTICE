  Modifications from the upstream source:
  1. Relative imports — absolute "from cvtub.xxx" converted to relative
     "from .xxx".  Each changed line is marked with
     "# polnet: relative import".
  2. GPU VRAM cleanup (generator.py only) — a 7-step cleanup block added
     at the end of _generate_shape() to prevent VRAM leaks.  Marked with
     "# polnet: comprehensive GPU VRAM cleanup".
  3. Code formatting — all .py files reformatted with black (line-length
     79) on 2026-02-26 for consistency with the polnet codebase.
     No functional changes.
